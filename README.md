# knowlaravel
Laravel project for experiments


This will serve as repo for all experiments knowing how to code laravel.

#### Setup

1. Create `.env` file to your root directory
2. Copy content from `.env.example` to newly created `.env` (make sure you make necessary changes on `.env` depending on your local setup)
3. Create database on your local (name it anything you want, initial name: `knowlaravel_db`)
4. Run `composer install`
5. Run `php artisan migrate`
6. Run `php artisan serve` (then access to browser)

If nothing goes wrong, you're all set.
